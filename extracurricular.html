    <div class="main-text multi-column">
      <p>Was it when I first went for climbing a small hill in Mumbai or was it when I saw the different architectural marvels of India, I don‚Äôt quite remember but one thing is for sure- Travelling has a soft spot in my heart. My friends call me a travel freak as a result of my every ready nature towards travelling. Travelling has taught me so many things that I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. Be it to look at things with different views or be it meeting new people with different backgrounds, travelling has made my once restricted view towards life wider. </p>
      <p> One of my missions in life is to travel the whole world and discover new things through out that journey. And who know knows maybe one day I will also travel beyond the surface of this planet.

      <h4>Organizing Events</h4>
      <div class="multi-column">
        <p>Helping AStA (The General Students' Committee) is really fun. Being in an International University, we plan lots of new events and celebrate festivals from different parts of the world. Planning the project and solving the uncertain situations only to make the overall event a success is quite the pump of adrenaline. Talking to so many students about random things is also really amusing. Helping the student body has led me to making new friends and understand the real hype behind the university life which the graduates have always told me about. </p>

      <h4>Football</h4>
      <p>The simple joy a football can bring to me is unique. Be it watching or playing football, I love
        it all

      <h4>Piano</h4>
      <p>My friends on Instagram have been bombarding their stories with all the new hobbies they have found in this stay at home situation. This gave me the initial motivation to start something new too- Piano. Right now, I am not so good with it but I guess ‚ÄúPractice makes a man perfect‚Äù. Let‚Äôs see where this goes.</p></a><a class="item-with-image style" href="#" target="_blank">
      <h4>Sinking beneath the surface</h4>
      <p>Diving- This one was unexpected. Growing up watching movies like ‚ÄúJaw‚Äù, I was really hesitant to learn diving (Come on, have you seen that sharkü¶à). To be honest I was quite scared of the vast endless ocean but one of my friends gave me some encouragement and dragged me to the waters, and believe me, It was the best thing that I have bet my life on (a big exaggerationü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ‚Äç ). I just hope to explore more of this amazing work in the future and hopefully not get eaten by that shark.</p></a><a class="item-with-image toggles" href="#" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1470549813517-2fa741d25c92?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjF9"/>
      <h4>Buon appetito!</h4>
      <p>Cooking- A long time hobby of mine which I have neglected quite a lot for the past few years seems to have resurfaced this year again. Making new dishes which I have previously only seen at restaurants has become a reality now. Maybe I will become the next Master ChefüòÇ.</p></a><a class="menu" href="#" target="_blank">

          <p>Do you also like to take pictures wherever you are? Me too!
            Some smart person once said ‚ÄúA picture is worth thousand words‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt agree more.
            Taking pictures gives one the chance to revisit those moments in the past leaving one with a smile on one‚Äôs face. Nostalgia can be such a weird thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            As every other millennial out there, I have been constantly testing my camera‚Äôs limits no matter if it is scorching hot or pouring down from the heavens. Nothing beats capturing the beautiful nature. And if someone is lucky one will see the unseen in the pictures. Those hidden gems!!!

        <h5>Artificial Intelligence and Robotics</h5>
        <p>These topics are certainly talked about on all types of media nowadays. I started learning about them as a result of my curiosity, but they have quickly consumed my day to day life. They never cease to amaze me. The sheer speed at which the development in these areas is going ahead is record breaking. I am trying to learn about them by doing some small scale projects and I hope to find an internship in these fields if possible. For the time being, I guess I have a long way to go.</p></a><a class="sidebar-item slack-ui with-border" href="#" target="_blank">
        <h5>Coding.Coding.Coding</h5>
        <p>One thing I have learned in this quarantine is that hot chocolate goes really well with codingüòÇ. On a more serious note I have been coding non stop for the previous few months; be it Python, C++ or HTML. Quite fun to build algorithms which decides what to make for dinner right!!!</p></a>

        <h5>TV Series connoisseur</h5>
        <p>This year due to plenty of free time ü¶†, I think I have finally achieved the title of TV series Connoisseur (self proclaimedüôÑüòÇ). To name a few I have watched American, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Japanese and Korean TV series. To be honest I did not expect to enjoy a series in a language I am totally foreign to but to my surprise I really enjoyed them.
          I guess one reason might be that the problems revolving humans are more or less the same no matter where we go. I am really looking forward to watching more series.
